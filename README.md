## Project Motivation

My primary motivations for studying the COVID 19 dataset are given below,

1. What is the month-wise progress of number new cases of covid-19 for all the countries?
2. What is the month-wise progress of number total cases of covid-19 for all the countries?
3. What is future time series evolution of total number of covid 19 cases in India?
